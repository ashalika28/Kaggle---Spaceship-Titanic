**This is my solution for Kaggle Competition called Spaceship Titanic**

Here are few Sections

# 1. Import kaggle dependencies and auth

- In here import kagle api key and load dataset related to spaceship titanic problem

# 2. Explotary Data Analysis

- Understand each varibales individually and getting decissions according to that

# 3. Data Understanding with mutiple varibales

- Comapre some Mutilpel variables [ continous vs continous , continous vs categorical , categorical vs categorical]
   
# 4. Pre Processing

- Handle missing values
- Drop columns
- Feature extarctions
- Data type comversions

# 5. Apply Pre Processing & Feature Enginnering

- Perform function called Preprocessing(), feature_enginnering(), column_drops()
- Split data to train and test 

# 6. Modeling

- Make pipeline with relavant hyper parameters
- Fit models with using pipeline 
- Models used (RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier)
- Use StandarScaler to scale data

# 7. Evaluations

- Get Accuracy, Precisions and Recall or each Model
- Choose best algorithm 

# 8. Conclusion

- Make some notes of pre proccesing, models and evaluations

# 9. Save Models

- Save model for future use

# 10. Predict On Test Data

- Get predictions on kaggle test data which have provided
- Make dataframe which require for submission

# 11. Kaggle Submission

- Make csv file 
- Submit


**Enjoy with changing hyper parameters and get more accurated models**
